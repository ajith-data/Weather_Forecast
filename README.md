🌦️ Weather Forecast Dashboard – Power BI + Real-Time API Integration

I created a Weather Forecast Dashboard in Power BI using a real-time weather API.
This dashboard provides live updates and interactive insights into weather conditions across multiple cities in India.

🔹 Key Features:

🌡️ Current Weather Conditions – Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Visibility, Pressure, UV Index, and Precipitation.

📊 Forecast Trendline – 7-day forecast with temperature trends.

🌍 Location-based Mapping – Dynamic weather updates on the map.

🌅 Sunrise & Sunset Timings for the selected city.

🍃 Air Quality Index (AQI) – PM10, PM2.5, SO2, CO, O3, and NO2 levels displayed in real-time.

⚡ API Integration – Automated refresh for the latest weather data.
